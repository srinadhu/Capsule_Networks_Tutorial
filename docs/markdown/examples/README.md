This directory contains example LaTeX and ConTeXt documents. These documents
can be typeset by running the GNU `make` program in this directory. It is
expected that your TeX installation contains the `pdflatex`, `xelatex`,
`lualatex`, `texexec`, and `context` executables.

The `markdown.dtx` file in the root directory contains documentation in the
markdown language and can also serve as an example LaTeX document.
