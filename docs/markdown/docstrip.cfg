MODIFICATION ADVICE:

If you want to customize this file, it is best to make a copy of
the source file(s) from which it was produced.  Use a different

the same name as a standard file.

You will also need to produce your own, suitably named, .ins file to
control the generation of files from your source file; this file
should contain your own preambles for the files it generates, not
those in the standard .ins files.

The names of the source files used are shown above.
